## I have created 2 different ways how to do 1 iteration of the drink_machine


1. Using tdd and ddd

go to [folder](./coffee_machine_ddd)

```
poetry shell
pytest test_ordering.py 
```

2. using pattern command and bdd

go to [folder](./drink_machine_bdd)

```
poetry shell
behave features/MakeADrink.feature

```
